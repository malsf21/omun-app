# OMUN App

Heya there! I'm Matt, the USG of Communications for OMUN 2017. This is the OMUN App (Ionic Version). Right now, I'm working on pulling and parsing information from the omun.ca API. I'll update the documentation of the app as I go, especially after I finish exams and have a lot of free time.

If you see any issues, please let me know on my Issue Tracker!

## Things This App Does

* Give you short blurbs about the conference
* Gives you a temporary schedule and conference timeline (all filler content)
* Gives you committee information, including description
* Gives you full-text news updates
* Pull information from the OMUN Web API (such as news and committees)
* Actual countdown until OMUN 2017
* Tells you who made the app and how
* Looks pretty dope

## Things This App Doesn't Do (but Might In The Future)

* Have caching of latest pull of information from OMUN API for offline use
* Network connection offline indicator
* More descriptive content in general
* Have Documentation on testing, coding, building, deploying, and maintaining
* Have better coding practices

## Things This App Will Not Do (For the Foreseeable Future)

* Store any sensitive user data
* Allow registration from the app
* Give you the meaning of life
